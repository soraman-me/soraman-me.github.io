								Summary and Research Questions
								My observations were based on three key points, the ease of creating or joining a community, ways to
								maintain and moderate the community and lastly the ease of navigating through discussions
								and posts. Creating a server in Discord was faster and took less effort than creating a
								workspace in slack. The presence of ‘roles’ definitely helps in moderating large communities
								whereas absence of it in slack suggests slack is meant for smaller scale, ‘team
								collaboration’. The text chat structure does feel disjointed in Discord whereas in Slack it feels
								organised and connected to the purpose of the workspace. As for the voice chat Discord has
								voice channels which allow conversations to move seamlessly from text to voice. Both chats
								had similar technical content but the lingo in which they were being discussed was different,
								which made me think about the ways in which a culture associated with a platform influences
								its user’s way of communicating.
								The feeling I got while using Slack was that of a closed space similar to an office cubicle,
								whereas Discord made me feel like I was at a Carnival, chaotic but every feature has a
								purpose and users were having ‘fun’ with them. At the time I thought it would be interesting
								to discuss how others felt about it and what qualities associated with respective platforms
								induced that feeling. 
							</p>
							<p class="para">
								Slack and Discord are aimed at different audiences but both platforms
								have similar if not same core features, a research question could be drawn out on how same
								features are being implemented differently ? Another broader question can be, despite
								having the same underlying technology and common features, why is Slack and Discord
								being used for two different purposes?

								The criteria of collaborative forums, especially features shared between Slack and Discord, were used to define and generate many research questions. These criteria were:
								
								<ol>
									<li>Authentication</li>
									<li>Channel / workspace (server) management</li>
									<li>File sharing, managing documents</li>
									<li>Live streaming

									<li>Thread (Slack)</li>
								</ol>
								<p class="para">
									Above all, the research question must focus on collaboration in academic context. The focus research question, “How do Slack and Discord compare in their capability to enable academic collaboration between students,” is a very broad research question that can be intersected with many other generated questions as listed below:
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>How are different contexts managed within a specific channel?</li>
									<li>When is a channel created in a workspace/server?</li>
									<li>How do Slack vs Discord enable academic collaboration between students?</li>
									<li>How do students discuss course work with other students in Slacks vs Discord?</li>
									<li>How do students and professors discuss course work in Slack vs Discord?</li>
									<li>How do Slack vs Discord enable discussion on academic projects between students?</li>
									<li>How do Slack vs Discord enable academic collaboration in group projects among students?</li>
									<li>How do people feel they should communicate with others on Slack vs Discord?</li>
									<li>What capabilities in Slack and Discord are used to conduct academic conversations?</li>
									<li>Despite having the same underlying technology and common features, why is Slack and Discord being used for two different purposes?</li>
									<li>How do students collaborate on school topics using Slack?</li>
									<li>Slack-specific: how does Slack emulate that Office feelings through its various features? Discord Equivalent: replace Office with Carnival.</li>
									<li>How are conversations (collaboration enabled or conducted) driven in group via channel?</li>
								</ol>

								The general purpose of collecting data is to find out how collaborative forums are used in an academic setting and what are the present problems plaguing productivity. Looking at two similar collaborative forums -- Slack and Discord, the interviews and observations from students both uncover their stories and what issues they run into.  The interview questions along with their categories are listed as follow:

								Online Interview
								The interview was scheduled for October 28th, 10:30 pm IST and was conducted over a Discord call. Interviewer and the interviewee were on a voice call with no external interference, screen sharing was turned on by the interviewee for the task walkthrough. Entire interview was voice recorded for note taking. 
								The participant was a twenty three year old male, graduate student studying computer science at University of California San Diego and was also a teaching assistant for the computer science department. According to the interview, the participant used Discord as a teaching assistant for an informal communication channel to communicate with students, for official, structured communication students used canvas. In order to keep track of conversation about multiple topics he had setup channels for different subjects. His tasks as a teaching assistant are to answer any course or college related questions students might have and to moderate the discussions and make sure that students do not violate the academic integrity by discussing homework problems. These tasks are accomplished by using text chat and the feature to delete other’s texts that is granted as an ‘admin’ role. He added someone with an admin role can make others admin, can give and take away power to view certain features for example on clicking more options on a message he sees a ‘delete chat’ option but the students do not. Upon asking about voice communication he revealed, almost all of the communication takes place through text the reason being that there are other options like office hours and zoom office time which students use for vocal discussions. He further added, he would prefer if students used Discord voice feature as it also allows him to quickly share his screen and draw to explain some answers more clearly compared to just using text. Talking about Slack, as the participant is also a student he used slack workspaces created by respective subject professors for different subjects.

								As we had planned a semi-structured interview I did ask a few sub questions and two additional open ended questions. These two questions were aimed at getting insights for his decision to use slack for some functions and discord for others. To the question “ Why is slack preferred for  professional or academic settings ?” he answered it is about the branding of those platforms, Discord was initially marketed towards gaming whereas Slack presents itself as more formal and tries to go for professionals. The second question was. “Given a scenario where your purpose for the study group, group mates, topics of discussion, academic setting and all other factors are equal for Slack and Discord, in what situation would you prefer Discord and in what situation Slack ?” to which he said personally he would choose discord most of the time because he regularly uses discord for non academic reasons anyways and it is convenient for him to have everything in one place. He said he would use slack in case his group mates or other collaborators are not comfortable with discord.

							<h5>List of Problems</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>Participant was unable to locate the “Add Server” button without external guidance</li>
								<li>The inbuilt voice and screen sharing functionality is not appealing to students who are accustomed to traditional meeting platforms</li>
								<li>Discord is ‘informal’</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="para">
								The first problem seems to relate with visibility of the button and the user was clearly able to locate and carry out other functionalities effortlessly. This could be caused due to the fact that the “Add Server Button” is at the bottom of the joined server list and the user needs to scroll through the list in order for it to be visible.
								The second problem may be a case of perception. As said in the interview students use other platforms for voice functionality when a feature with exact same functionality is just one click away in Discord. As platforms like zoom, google meet etc market themselves for meetings, students may be perceiving Discord as a text based community where voice chat is an alternative to their other alternatives.
								Third point is not necessarily a problem but a characteristic of the platform. Participant mentioned slack is marketed towards users who prefer formal setting, this begs the question what makes Discord feel informal ? Is it the culture surrounding it, its art style or some other features, what visual and functional differences gets a platform labeled as formal or informal ?

							<h5>Findings</h5>
							<p class="para">
								A young undergraduate or an older professor would certainly have a different perspective of these platforms than our interview population.
							</p>
							<p class="para">
								Additional interviews with people with disability would shed more light on how accessible these platforms really are. As noted in the profile table earlier, Discord has ‘voice channels’ that are really video-audio channels, but no one would realize the video component on first glance because the so named ‘voice’ channels are represented by a speaker icon. We assume that screen-readers can be used in both platforms, but would need interviews to corroborate ease of usage and navigation.
							</p>
							<p class="para">
								The adoption of Slack or Discord at an institution is very dependent on what the majority uses. Depending on how big the population and how much they use it, sometimes users also need extra storage space or features. Pricing and unique features can impact which platform takes the majority and this should be considered as a potential avenue of research.
							</p>
							<p class="para">
								This exercise is focused on demographics by role — Strict academic study, group and social work, teacher, and volunteer — but there is also demographics by platform usage — Discord, Slack, both, and none. Further study might consider how roles and platforms intertwine. Platform has a significant impact on the environment of the users and thus their culture.

						<h1>Storyboarding with Scenarios</h1>
						<div class="paragraph py-4 w-30">
							<p class="para">
								Based on our data collection, an academic discussion usually starts on a text-based platform like Slack or Discord, and then the group ends up using other popular video services like Zoom or Google Meet to continue the discussion over video. It turns out the video feature is present and just a few clicks away in both Slack and Discord, but this feature is not visible to the users and is especially unknown to the novice users. Also, as Discord markets itself as a text and voice-based forum, users are less likely to look for a video feature. This storyboard includes the user persona, Nadia Bolas, as she works from a home workspace on a desktop computer while using Discord in a browser window.
							</p>
							<h5>Problem Scenario</h5>
							<p class="para">
								Nadia Bolas is a DHH undergraduate student that only uses communication platforms when there is a reason to do so. For instance, she only uses Slack because companies and hosts use it for their events. Other than that, Nadia tends to use Discord as most of her friends use that platform, but she only uses the text channel as she cannot speak. One day, she suffered a miscommunication with her friend named Sam while using Discord and Sam suggested a video chat to solve the misunderstanding. However, Nadia thought there was no such option in Discord. Sam explained to her that if she selected the voice channel in the channel sidebar, the option to have a video meeting would be presented. Nadia has never seen the video meeting capability before as she would have never selected a voice channel in the first place. So, after doing as Sam said, Nadia found the video meeting option nested within the voice channel and selected it, and successfully met with him on the Discord video call.

							<h5>Design Solution Scenario</h5>
							<p class="para">
								Reimagine the original problem scenario where Discord has three separate kinds of channels which are now labeled as text, voice, and video. There is a miscommunication in the text channel over a project between Nadia and a friend, Sam. Sam suggests a meeting on the video channel. Nadia sees the clearly labeled video channels. She is not confused by the speaker icon under voice channels as the video channels are also marked with the camera icon! They meet on a video channel, clear up the miscommunication, and she knows that Discord can be used for text, voice, and video forms of communication.
