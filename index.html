      Robert Johnson is deemed one of the most famous musicians of the Delta Blues style. 
      Historically, the Blues genre emerged after the Civil War and has its origin in poor African-American
      persons of the South. Eventually, work songs, sung by former black slaves 
      while toiling in the fields, were transformed into Blues. Themes of injustice, relationships  
      between men and women, discrimination, and family life â€“ all private pleasures and sufferings, 
      were explored in such music. As was customary for most Blues artists, Robert Johnson 
      took existing songs and reappropriated them in his own personal style.
      This was a tradition employed predominantly within American folk music, specifically 
      within the Blues. Thus Hellhound On My Trail is similar in melodies, riffs,and chord progressions to Devil Got My Woman by Skip James.<br>

  If you choose to do the design prompt in the Typography video, please link your URL here. As a reminder, the prompt asks for a webpage with four things:

  1. Lyrics to Hellhound on my Trail by Robert Johnson

  2. A paragraph about the song / about Johnson

  3. A graphic - a photo or drawing that fits the song somehow

  4. A color palette that fits the song - a color bar with five colors like what you would see at color.adobe.com

  The typography should be influenced by webtypography.net
